# TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization

This repository will contain my solutions for the Tensorflow: Advanced Specialization course on Coursera.  

## Course 1: Custom Models,Layers, and Loss Functions with Tensorflow

This first course introduces you to Tensor Flow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.

#### Week 1: A New Programming Paradigm
Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!

Good article describing the different versions of the Inception network:
