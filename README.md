# TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization

This repository will contain my solutions for the Tensorflow: Advanced Specialization course on Coursera.  

## Course 1: Custom Models,Layers, and Loss Functions with Tensorflow

This first course introduces you to Tensor Flow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.
